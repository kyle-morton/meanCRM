This project is an extension of the MEAN CRM application created in the book MEAN Machine. 
It features a Node.js server with Express.js to create the backend api routing.
It also features an Angular.js frontend application with it's own routing set up with view injection
as well as Mongoose ODM to work with the MongoDB nosql database. Currently, this is just a test
app that I'll add to over time as I learn more about the MEAN stack and what tools are available.
